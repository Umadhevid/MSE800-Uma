Week 5 Activity 5: question - when we can use inheritance?
Can we update the code with adding a "Course" class to Week 5, Activity 3? See attached file: 

Yes, we can add "Course" class to the existing code.
But we cannot inherit the Course class to any of the existing class.
For inheritance, the class should have "is a" relationship.
If the class have "has/can have" relationship , we cannot inherit.

ex. Person is a student
person can have course
